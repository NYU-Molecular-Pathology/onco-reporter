Breast Carcinoma,ERBB2,Default,1/2,12/6/21,"ERBB2 (also HER2) is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Activation of ERBB2-mediated signaling ultimately results in cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation. ERBB2 is activated by gene amplification and overexpression in a range of human cancers including breast, gastric, and endometrial tumors, among others. ERBB2 amplification is present in ~12% of breast carcinoma patients and is associated with poor overall survival and time to tumor recurrence. Several HER2 targeted therapies are FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer including the HER2 targeted antibodies trastuzumab, pertuzumab and margetuximab-cmkb, the antibody-drug conjugates ado-trastuzumab emtansine (TDM1) and trastuzumab deruxtecan, and the HER kinase inhibitors lapatinib, neratinib, and tucatinib.","1.

Colorectal Adenocarcinoma,CTNNB1,Default,1/2,12/6/21,"CTNNB1 encodes the protein b-catenin, a transcriptional activator involved in the WNT signaling pathway.
